            <h2>📈 When is payment made?</h2>
<p>
    Salary is paid weekly to your personal bank card. In Almaty, it's every Wednesday; in Astana and other cities, it's every Friday.
    Additionally, for each completed order, you'll receive an additional 22% for taxes (pension contributions, medical insurance, income tax).
</p>
<br>

<h2>❓ What if my card is blocked or seized?</h2>
<p>
    Payments are made only to your personal bank account. Payments to another person's account are not allowed. If your card is blocked, the bank will withhold 50% of the salary.
</p>
<br>

<h2>💵 Can I receive payment in cash?</h2>
<p>
    No, payments are only made to your personal bank account.
</p>
<br>

<h2>📝 How is the process of registration carried out?</h2>
<p>
    Fill in your details after selecting a side job (online). Based on the information provided, a contract is formed. Sign the contract using cloud-based Electronic Signature (Face ID).
</p>
<br>

<h2>📑 Why is a contract necessary?</h2>
<p>
    They operate officially under a service contract. This guarantees salary payment and fulfillment of all agreements. The contract is indefinite and can be terminated by you via the application.
</p>
<br>

<h2>⏳ What if I already have a full-time job (employment contract)?</h2>
<p>
    Their contract is not an employment contract, allowing you to combine the side job with your main job.
</p>
<br>

<h2>🗓️ Do I need to work every day?</h2>
<p>
    No, you decide when to work. For instance, if you're free tomorrow, you can enter the app and accept an order for the next day. There's no obligation to work every day.
</p>
<br>

<h2>🔒 Why do you need to provide an IBAN account?</h2>
<p>
    An IBAN account is not confidential information. It's used solely for salary deposits (you can confirm this with the bank).
</p>
<br>

<h2>🔐 Do you guarantee the safety of data?</h2>
<p>
    Yes, the contract (section 6) outlines responsibility for data safety.
